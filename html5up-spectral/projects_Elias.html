								<h2>Design 1<br />
								Day 1</h2>
								<p>To start off this project, I had the intention of further my understanding of drones. Despite me building drones 
									with already set kits, such as ones from VexCode that you buy off the internet, I feel like designing and creating
									drones with my bare hands through the materials found in my very house. This would be my first design, with 4 dc motors held up by 4
									precisely cut popsicle sticks, binded by hot glue.

								<h2>Design 2<br />
								Day 2</h2>
								<p>I realized my design previously was fairly heavy and not suitable enough for flight due to the lack
									of power which my motors had. So in response to this, I decided to remodel my design, more accurately
									in a CAD software to have a better approach. This design used half the materials, ending up with half
									of the weight of my original design.

								<h2>Final Project<br />
								Day 3-4</h2>
								<p>I finally set my sights on starting to build my mini drone, scaled 5.75in x 5.75in due to the size 
									my popsicle sticks found in the shelves of my garage. I found some old wires, propellers, and motors from 
									the previous drones that I built with my older brother years previously. After about 2 hours of assembling my drone, binded
									with messy plops of glue from my hot glue gun, which I burned myself about 10 times with, my drone was finally finished. I 
									attached the wires to 2 double A batteries and hoped for the best. But unfortunately it didn't fly.
								</p>
								<p> After 30 minutes of attempting to fix it I finally found the problem. One of my wires werent properly connected
									 leading to all of the motors not being able to work. After I fixed that issue, I unfortunately found another problem.
									  I somehow failed to account that just 2 double a batteries cannot provide enough power to 4 motors. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Ongoing to the next day, I had a new approach of wiring each motor to their own set of batteries. After I was done wiring,
									I turned each motor on and hoped for the best. And I finally did it, even though it wasn't perfect as it can only fly upwards, it finally took
									flight.
